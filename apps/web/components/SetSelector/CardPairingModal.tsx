/**
 * NEO-137 — card-level pairing, before any NB card exists.
 *
 * Deliberately the same three-bucket screen the operator already knows from
 * set reconciliation (ReconciliationModal): matched pairs, unmatched-BSC,
 * unmatched-SL, plus a keep shelf for a card that legitimately lives on only
 * one marketplace. The vocabulary is identical because the problem is:
 * "these two lists describe the same things, tell me which line up".
 *
 * Why this exists at all: when two NB rows share one SportLots set — 1996
 * Score's Dugout Collection Artist's Proofs Series 1 and 2 both mapping to the
 * single SL "Dugout Collection Artists Proofs" — the sibling row's cards come
 * back in this row's SL fetch. Materialising them would invent bogus cards
 * under this row. Here they simply sit in unmatched-SL and are dropped unless
 * the operator deliberately keeps one, which is the same rule set
 * reconciliation already uses for marketplace noise.
 *
 * Nothing is written until Confirm. Cards are generated from confirmed pairs
 * plus kept singles, and only then do the player/team/Wikidata syncs run.
 *
 * Keyboard model (matches ReconciliationModal):
 *   Tab    — cycles filters, rows, footer buttons
 *   Enter  — confirm when focus is on Confirm
 *   Escape — cancel

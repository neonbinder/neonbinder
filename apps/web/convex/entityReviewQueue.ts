 *
 * Lifecycle: fetchCardChecklist (an action — transitively admin-gated via
 * its own call to getAncestorChain, which requires admin) calls `startBatch`
 * for any unknown names it surfaces. The wizard subscribes to `getBatch` and
 * calls `recordDecision` once per row as the user reviews. `commitCardChecklist`
 * (admin-gated) reads the finished batch to resolve its decisions, then
 * schedules `cleanupBatch`. A decision is create, link, or — NEO-212 — skip
 * ("not a person / not a team"): a skipped row creates and links nothing, the
 * card keeps the raw name as free text, and commit records the name in
 * `entityReviewSkips` so it stays out of this set's wizard on later fetches.
 * `cancelBatch` is the wizard's Cancel action — it only ever touches these
 * throwaway rows, never `players`/`teams`/`cardChecklist`. Every public
 * function here is admin-gated (requireAdmin), matching every other function
 * in selectorOptions.ts — even though the blast radius of this table alone is
 * small, there's no reason a non-admin should be able to read/mutate it at all.

 * Internal — the pool's lookup work item patches status/enrichment as each

 *
 * ## Why this reads before it writes (NEO-189)
 *
 * A row that already carries a `decision` is LEFT ALONE. This used to patch
 * unconditionally, and that is what turned a seed job red: the operator's
 * "mark everything as create" fast path (`recordAllRemainingAsCreate`)
 * deliberately decides rows whose lookup is still `pending`, the operator hits
 * Confirm, and `commitCardChecklist`'s prelude then reads the whole batch
 * through `by_selector_option_and_batch`. Every straggler lookup landing here
 * during that read invalidated the prelude's read set, and with a lookup storm
 * in flight (CI hit an ESPN 403 retry loop) it lost on Convex's every internal
 * retry too:
 *
 *   Documents read from or written to the "entityReviewQueue" table changed
 *   while this mutation was being run and on every subsequent retry. A call to
 *   "entityReviewQueue.js:applyLookupResult" changed the document…
 *
 * The write was pointless as well as harmful. `enrichment` has exactly two
 * consumers: the commit prelude, which reads it to seed a newly created
 * player/team, and the review wizard's detail panel — and the wizard only ever
 * renders a row that is NOT decided (`EntityReviewWizard`'s `current` filters
 * on `!r.decision`). So once a decision exists, nothing will ever read the
 * enrichment this patch would store: commit has either already read the row or
 * is about to, and either way it finishes by deleting the batch.
 *
 * This does NOT weaken the "a row is never stranded on pending" invariant —
 * see `backstopEntityReviewRowImpl`, which carries the same guard and the
 * argument for why.

/**
 * The workpool completion backstop (NEO-99), as a plain exported function so

 * registered mutation. `onEntityReviewLookupComplete` in wikidataPool.ts is the
 * one-line delegation the pool actually calls.
 *
 * The invariant it guarantees: a review row can never be stranded on `pending`.
 * `runEntityReviewLookup` resolves the row on its own happy and caught-error
 * paths, so this normally finds the row already "ready"/"error" and no-ops. It
 * exists for the residue that path cannot reach from within itself — an uncaught
 * throw, an action-level timeout, or a pool cancellation, in each of which the
 * action never ran its patch. In all of those the row is still `pending` when
 * the work item finally completes, and this ages it to "error" ("No Wikidata
 * match found"), which is the honest end state for a lookup that produced
 * nothing usable.
 *
 * `result.kind` is not branched on: whatever terminal shape the work item ended
 * in, a still-`pending` row means "no result landed", and "error" is the
 * resolution for every one of them. An already-resolved row is left exactly as
 * the action set it (a real "ready" with enrichment is never downgraded).
 * `decision` is never touched, so a row bulk-decided while its lookup was in
 * flight keeps its decision.
 *
 * ## NEO-189: a DECIDED row is skipped, and that does not weaken the invariant
 *
 * Same guard, same reason as `applyLookupResult` above — a write here on a row
 * the commit prelude is reading is what made the seed job's commit lose an
 * optimistic-concurrency race on every retry.
 *
 * The invariant this function exists for is about rows the operator has NOT
 * ruled on: those are the ones the wizard blocks on, and they still get aged
 * exactly as before. A DECIDED row left sitting on `pending` is inert — the
 * wizard's `current` skips decided rows entirely, its "N of M" counts
 * decisions rather than statuses, so nothing blocks on the status — and it does
 * not survive: `commitCardChecklist` deletes the whole batch when it finishes,
 * `cancelBatch` deletes it on Cancel, and `sweepStalePendingRows` ages whatever
 * an abandoned wizard leaves behind after ENTITY_REVIEW_STALE_MS.
